            >Michael Joseph Jackson</a
          >
          was born in Gary, Indiana, near Chicago, on August 29, 1958. He was an
          American singer, songwriter, and dancer. Dubbed the "King of Pop", he
          is regarded as one of the most significant cultural figures of the
          20th century. Through stage and video performances, he popularized
          complicated dance techniques such as the moonwalk, to which he gave
          the name. His sound and style have influenced artists of various
          genres, and his contributions to music, dance, and fashion, along with
          his publicized personal life, made him a global figure in popular
          culture for over four decades. Jackson is the most awarded artist in
          the history of popular music.

          The eighth child of the Jackson family, Jackson made his professional
          debut in 1964 with his elder brothers Jackie, Tito, Jermaine, and
          Marlon as a member of the Jackson 5. Jackson began his solo career in
          1971 while at Motown Records, and rose to solo stardom with his fifth
          studio album Off the Wall (1979) during the peak of the disco era. By
          the early 1980s, Jackson became a dominant figure in popular music.
          His music videos, including those for "Beat It", "Billie Jean", and
          "Thriller" from his sixth studio album Thriller (1982), are credited
          with breaking racial barriers and transforming the medium into an art
          form and promotional tool. Jackson's prominence propelled him and the
          television channel MTV into cultural phenomenons of 1980s pop culture.
          At the 1984 Grammy Awards, Thriller won a record-breaking eight Grammy
          Awards, including Album of the Year. Jackson continued to innovate
          with videos on the global best-seller albums Bad (1987), Dangerous
          (1991) and HIStory: Past, Present and Future, Book I (1995).

          Starting in the late 1980s, Jackson became a figure of controversy and
          speculation due to his changing appearance, relationships, behavior
          and lifestyle. In 1993, he was accused of sexually abusing the child
          of a family friend. The lawsuit was settled out of court, and Jackson
          was not indicted. In 2005, he was tried and acquitted of further child
          sexual abuse allegations and several other charges. In 2009, while
          preparing for a series of comeback concerts, This Is It, Jackson died
          from an overdose of propofol administered by his personal physician,
          Conrad Murray.

            Jackson's estimated sales of over 350 million records worldwide,
            make him the best-selling pop act of all time and the
            third-best-selling music artist in history. He had 13 number-one
            singles in the US in his solo career—more than any other male artist
            in the Hot 100 era. He was invited and honored by a President of the
            United States at the White House three times. In 1984, he was
            honored with a "Presidential Public Safety Commendation" award by
            Ronald Reagan for his humanitarian endeavors. In 1990, he was
            honored as the "Artist of the Decade" by George H. W. Bush. In 1992,
            he was honored as a "Point of Light Ambassador" by Bush for inviting
            disadvantaged children to his Neverland Ranch.

            Jackson won hundreds of awards, more than any other popular music
            recording artist. His awards include 39 Guinness World Records,
            including the Most Successful Entertainer of All Time, 13 Grammy
            Awards, as well as the Grammy Legend Award and the Grammy Lifetime
            Achievement Award, and a record 26 American Music Awards, including
            the "Artist of the Century" and "Artist of the 1980s". He also was

            the Millennium and the Bambi Pop Artist of the Millennium Award.
            Jackson was inducted onto the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1980 as a
            member of the Jacksons, and in 1984 as a solo artist. He was
            inducted to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Vocal Group Hall of
            Fame as a member of The Jackson 5 in 1997 and 1999, respectively,
            and again as a solo artist in 2001. In 2002 he was added to the
            Songwriters Hall of Fame. In 2010, Jackson was the first recording
            artist to be inducted into the Dance Hall of Fame, and in 2014 he
            was posthumously inducted into the Rhythm and Blues Music Hall of
            Fame.
